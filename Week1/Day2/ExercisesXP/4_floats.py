# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4: Floats
# Instructions
# Recap â€“ What is a float? What is the difference between an integer and a float?
# Create a list containing the following sequence 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5 (donâ€™t hard-code the sequence).
# Can you think of another way to generate a sequence of floats?

float_list = [0.5 * i for i in range(3, 11)]

print('Target list', float_list)
