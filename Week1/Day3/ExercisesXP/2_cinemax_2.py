# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2 : Cinemax #2
# Instructions
# A movie theater charges different ticket prices depending on a personâ€™s age.
# if a person is under the age of 3, the ticket is free.
# if they are between 3 and 12, the ticket is $10.
# if they are over the age of 12, the ticket is $15.

# Given the following object:

# family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}


# How much does each family member have to pay ?

# Print out the familyâ€™s total cost for the movies.
# Bonus: Ask the user to input the names and ages instead of using the 
# provided family variable (Hint: ask the user for names and ages and add them into a family dictionary that is initially empty).

family = {}
total_cost = 0
