# 1. *Class Attributes and Methods*:
#    - The class should keep track of the total number of bank accounts created and maintain a list of all accounts.
#    - Implement a class method to find an account by its account number.
#    - Implement a class method to summarize total balances across all accounts.
# 2. *Instance Attributes and Methods*:
#    - Use a @property to manage access to the account balance.
#    - Use a @property and @setter to handle and validate the account type.
#    - Include a transaction history that logs deposits and withdrawals.
#    - Implement a method to calculate and add interest to the account balance (specific to savings accounts).
#    - Implement methods for depositing and withdrawing money, with validation checks.

# Implementation Details
# 1. *Class Attributes*:
#    - __total_accounts: Tracks the total number of bank accounts created.
#    - __all_accounts: A list that stores references to all BankAccount instances.
#    - interest_rate: A class attribute to define the default interest rate for savings accounts.
# 2. *Class Methods*:
#    - get_total_accounts(cls): Returns the total number of accounts.
#    - find_account_by_number(cls, account_number): Finds and returns an account by its account number.
#    - total_balances(cls): Returns the sum of balances across all accounts.
# 3. *Properties*:
#    - balance: Provides access to the account balance.
#    - account_type: Manages the type of account with validation logic.
#    - transaction_history: A list that logs all transactions (deposits and withdrawals).
# 4. *Methods*:
#    - deposit(amount): Adds money to the account and logs the transaction.
#    - withdraw(amount): Withdraws money, ensuring the balance doesnâ€™t go negative, and logs the transaction.
#    - apply_interest(): Applies interest to savings accounts.
# Tasks to Complete
# 1. *Create the BankAccount class* with the provided class and instance attributes.
# 2. *Implement class methods* to manage and interact with the accounts collectively.
# 3. *Implement the @property and @setter* for the account balance and account type.
# 4. *Track transaction history* within each account.
# 5. *Test your class* by creating multiple accounts, performing various transactions, and applying interest.
