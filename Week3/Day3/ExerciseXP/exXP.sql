-- Get a list of all films joined with their languages ‚Äì select the following details : film title, description, and language name.
select f.title, f."description", l."name"
from film f

-- Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages ‚Äì select the following details : film title, description, and language name.

-- Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.

-- Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.
-- Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
-- It should have the following columns:
-- review_id ‚Äì a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
-- film_id ‚Äì references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
-- language_id ‚Äì references the language table. What language the review is in.
-- title ‚Äì the title of the review.
-- score ‚Äì the rating of the review (1-10).
-- review_text ‚Äì the text of the review. No limit on the length.
-- last_update ‚Äì when the review was last updated.

    review_id serial primary key
    , film_id integer references new_film (film_id) on delete cascade on update cascade

-- Delete a film that has a review from the new_film table, what happens to the customer_review table?

-- Exercise 2 : DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.

-- Check query for getting list of random films
select * from film as f

-- Ensure that expression will give a uniform distribution of numbers between 1 and 10
with sq as(
    select least(floor(random() * 10 + 1), 10) as rand_int
    from generate_series(1, 1e6)
) -- subquery for generating random numbers from 1 to 10
select rand_int, count(*), round(COUNT(*) / 1e6, 3) as proportion

-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the 
-- way in which we INSERT into the customer table?
-- Answer: In customers table properties it states that there is one
-- FK customer_address_id_fkey with CASCADE on update and RESTRICT on delete rules.
-- So when inserting we must ensure that address_id in present in the address table.

-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?
-- It has FK for the new_film table so it is a child table and there shouldn't be any problems droping it.
drop table customer_review;
